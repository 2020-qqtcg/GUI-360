# Eval Function
Code in `tool_func.py`
```python
def eval_tool(predict: dict | str, ground_truth: dict | str, ground_bbox: list | dict | None = None) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """
    Evaluate the tool prediction against the ground truth.

    Args:
        predict: The predicted tool call.
        ground_truth: The ground truth tool call.
        ground_bbox: The ground truth bounding box.

    Returns:
        A tuple of (function_match, args_match, status_match). For example: (1, 1, 1)

# Prompt Template
``` python
ACTION_PREDICTION_USER_PROMPT_QWEN = """You are a helpful assistant. Given a screenshot of the current screen, user instruction and history of actions, you need to decide the next action to take.

The instruction is:
{instruction}

The history of actions are:
{history}

The actions supported are:
{actions}
Important: All coordinate parameters for a predicted action must be absolute pixel positions on the screen, e.g., click(coordinate=[100, 200], button='left', double=False, pressed=None)

First, explain your reasoning processâ€”describe how you analyze the screenshot, understand the current state, and determine what action should be taken next based on the instruction and previous actions.

Then output your action within <tool_call></tool_call> tag like:
<tool_call>
{{
  "function": "<function name>",
  "args": {{}},
  "status": "CONTINUE"
}}
</tool_call>

If you think the task is finished, you can output status as "FINISH" and take no action. Like:
<tool_call>
{{
  "function": "",
  "args": {{}},
  "status": "FINISH"
}}
</tool_call>

Only **ONE** action should be taken at a time. If the instruction could apply to multiple elements, choose the most relevant one based on the context provided by the screenshot and previous actions.
